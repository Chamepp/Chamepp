In 2018, I was a quiet 15-year-old with a secondhand laptop and no roadmap.

I didn’t start with ambition. I started with questions.   Why do things work the way they do?  
And how can I build something that actually moves the world?

One evening, while browsing GitHub, I saw something strange.

A contributor badge. CPython. Used in the **Mars Rover mission**.

That moment changed everything.

I realized how far software could reach. How something I built in silence could impact the physical world.

Software wasn’t just lines of code. It was a force that could shape reality.

That idea stuck with me, that with the right tool, I could shift the world.

**Software is leverage.** And I wanted to use it well.

That became my lens moving forward:  

Don’t build for noise. Don’t build for ego.  

Build for impact. Build for permanence.  

Since then, I’ve followed one rule: **Build things that matter. Build things that live.**

## What I'm focused on. Shaping the Stack, Shaping the Future

Today, I contribute to Apple’s open-source ecosystem:

- [Swift Argument Parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser)  
- [DocC](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc)

My current focus: Integrating AI into Swift’s documentation tooling, using embeddings and large language models to **make docs smarter, searchable, and self-generating**.

The best software engineers are not those who build the most, but those who remove the most friction.

But my true focus goes beyond tools and code.

The software development life cycle is changing forever. AI is reshaping how we build, ship, and maintain software.

To be part of this movement, I’m building AI-powered solutions that push the boundaries of development:

**[SearchMind](https://github.com/Mindsblend/SearchMind)** — an intelligent AI-driven search engine that supports fuzzy, exact, pattern-based, and semantic search across codebases and content, designed for speed and extensibility.

**[SwiftTestGen](https://github.com/Chamepp/SwiftTestGen)** — an AI-powered test generation that understands your Swift codebase and automatically creates meaningful tests.

I want to help companies and businesses gain a leg up in the software market. By building the *right* software that expands reach, increases sales, and unlocks sustainable growth.

Because strategy and software aren’t separate. They’re intertwined.

And the future belongs to those who master both.

## From Idea to Impact

I love building products from scratch. Turning raw ideas into working, valuable software.  
From architecture to UX, launch to iteration, I enjoy the full journey.

I specialize in **web and mobile development**, and complement that with **technical writing** that explains complex systems with clarity.

I also love **strategy and leadership**. Seeing the long game, designing systems that scale, and helping people move in sync toward a meaningful goal and helping them reaching their full potential.

Over the years, I’ve grown through roles that reflect that spirit:

- **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador** — mentoring developers, running workshops, and building community early on.
- **FreeCodeCamp Author** — writing technical content that teaches, not just informs.
- **Apple OSS** — buidling software that impacts millions
- **iOS + Full Stack Engineer** — building real products under real constraints.
- **Startup Native** — I thrive in chaos. I love to strategize and lead. Turning ambiguity into momentum is where I live.
