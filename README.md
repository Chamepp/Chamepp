In 2018, I was a quiet 15-year-old with a secondhand laptop and no roadmap.

I didn’t start with ambition — I started with questions. Why do things work the way they do?  
And how can I build something that actually moves the world?

One evening, while browsing GitHub, I saw something strange.

A contributor badge. CPython. Used in the **Mars Rover mission**.

That moment changed everything.

I realized how far software could reach. How something I built in silence could impact the physical world.

Software wasn’t just lines of code. It was a force that could shape reality.

That idea stuck with me. That with the right tool, I could shift the world.

**Software is leverage.** And I wanted to use it well.

That became my lens moving forward:  

Don’t build for noise. Don’t build for ego.  

Build for impact. Build for permanence.  

Since then, I’ve followed one rule: **Build things that matter. Build things that live.**

## Work That Matters

Today, I contribute to Apple’s open-source ecosystem:

- [Swift Argument Parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser)  
- [DocC](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc)

My current focus:  
Integrating AI into Swift’s documentation tooling — using embeddings and large language models to **make docs smarter, searchable, and self-generating**.

Most developers avoid docs. I see them as a leverage point.

But my true focus goes beyond tools and code.

The software development life cycle is changing forever.  
AI is reshaping how we build, ship, and maintain software.

To be part of this movement, I’m building AI-powered solutions that push the boundaries of development:

**SearchMind** — an intelligent AI-driven search engine that supports fuzzy, exact, pattern-based, and semantic search across codebases and content, designed for speed and extensibility.

**SwiftestGen** — an AI-powered test generation and documentation tool that understands your Swift codebase and automatically creates meaningful tests and docs, accelerating quality and clarity.

I want to help companies and businesses gain a leg up in the software market.  
By building the *right* software — tailored to expand their reach, increase sales, and create lasting impact.

Because strategy and software aren’t separate.  
They’re intertwined.

And the future belongs to those who master both.

## Where I’ve Come From

- **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador**  
  Mentored student developers, ran workshops, built community.  

- **FreeCodeCamp Author**  
  Wrote technical articles designed to *teach*, not just inform.  

- **iOS + Full Stack Engineer**  
  Comfortable across the stack. Built real products under real constraints.  

- **Startup Native**  
  I work best in the early chaos. Turning ambiguity into product is where I live.
